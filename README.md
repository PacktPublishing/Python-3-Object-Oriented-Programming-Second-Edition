**Building robust and maintainable software with object oriented design patterns in Python**

## What is this book about?

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods
* Separate related objects into a taxonomy of classes and describe the properties and behaviors of those objects via the class interface
* Extend class functionality using inheritance
* Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly when not to use them
* Discover what design patterns are and why they are different in Python
